# Iceland Airwaves '25 tools
## listen to & rank artists, create a personal schedule

These scripts help you choose which shows you want to see at [Airwaves](https://icelandairwaves.is/) by listening to and ranking each artist, then generating a color-coded schedule based on your rankings to help you visualize your ideal schedule.

Both scripts use **[Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)**.

### `rank.py`: Listen to & rank the artists.

#### Dependencies

- **[mpv media player](https://mpv.io/)**
- **required Python libraries:**
  - `pyyaml`: `pip install pyyaml`

Run the `rank.py` script to begin your listening and ranking session.

```bash
python rank.py
```

The script randomly selects an artist from `artist_youtube_links.txt` and plays their sample song using `mpv`.

After `mpv` exits, you'll be prompted to rank the artist in the terminal.

*   Enter a rating from **1** to **10**.
*   Enter **`s`** to skip an artist for now.
*   Press **enter** with no input to replay the current song.

Your progress is saved to `rankings.yaml` after each entry. You can stop at any time (`Ctrl+C`) and the script will resume where you left off the next time you run it.

### `schedule.py`: Generate your personalized schedule.

#### **required Python libraries:**
  - `pyyaml`: `pip install pyyaml`

Once you have some rankings saved, run the `schedule.py` script.

```bash
python schedule.py
```

This will read your `schedule.txt` and `rankings.yaml` files and generate a new file, **`schedule.html`**. Open this file in your browser to see your beautiful, color-coded schedule! You can re-run this script as often as you like to update the HTML with your latest rankings.

## File Descriptions

### Scripts

*   `rank.py`: reads `artist_youtube_links.txt`, plays each song in `mpv`, and saves your ratings to `rankings.yaml`
*   `schedule.py`: reads `schedule.txt` and `rankings.yaml` to generate the final `schedule.html` file

### Data Files

*   `schedule.txt`: the formatted festival schedule

The format is:

```
Day
  Time
    Artist Name (Venue)
```

This file was auto-generated by Google Gemini using the HTML tables from [the official](https://icelandairwaves.is/schedule/) and [off-venue](https://icelandairwaves.is/special/) schedules, as pulled on November 1<sup>st</sup>. I make no guarantee of its accuracy, and last-minute changes and updates to the schedule are always possible, so be sure to double-check it against the official schedule. If you do notice anything wrong or missing, you can easily modify and correct this file (and submit a PR if you wish), as `schedule.py` references this.

*   `musicians.txt`: a list of all artists and their official artist page URLs, in format:

```
Artist Name (Country) [https://icelandairwaves.is/artist/{artist-name}]
```

*   `artist_youtube_links.txt`: YouTube video IDs, mostly extracted from the links in `musicians.txt`, in format:

```
Artist Name (Country) [{sample song YouTube video ID}]
```

*   `rankings.yaml`: your personal ratings, created and updated by the ranking script
